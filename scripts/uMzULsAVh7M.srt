00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I wonder what kind of person you are

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Even if you've walked the path you've taken, you're still a human

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're supported by someone, and you live your own way

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,379
Your mistakes are

4
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,000
The path you've taken

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can't go back, you can't go back

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I couldn't say it well enough

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To the hesitation you're hiding

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How many times have I been silent?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Because I share your worries and worries

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In this world, flowers are piling up

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sadness should have meaning

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sure you're strong

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're not the same

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're repeated, but you're still a human

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's step forward together while supporting someone

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
With the words of that day

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll take it, I'll take it

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You said, it's okay

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe it will come true

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm always by your side, but I'm scared

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because it's different

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
These feelings are sparkling

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They tell the meaning of the promise

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a human, even if I'm weak

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There's a place to go back

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll definitely remember you

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want to be with someone

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sure this miracle will happen

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I looked up at the sky

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't see the stars

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The tears that float in your eyes

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was definitely trapped

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm a human, I'm worried

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Even if I'm not mistaken on the way I've walked

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because I'm a human

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm supported by someone

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm just a human who lives like myself

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm a human, I'm not limitless

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In the dark that continues

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you follow the footsteps, you'll see the future

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm walking on someone's side

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll sing with my own hand

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:51,000
