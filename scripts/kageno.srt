00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
All of this, for now

1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Until we reach the ideal

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,500
I'll reach out my hand

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,500
The choice that grows in front of me

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The gears of good and evil are moving towards the end of one single thing

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, come on, cause I'm your choice

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
And I'm back to the end of life

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Until the limits of my body

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I'll look at the future

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Only one, I don't need anyone else

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
To be one, I just want to see it

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,500
I'll keep my faith and determination in my heart

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Highest, highest, I'm the best

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll go beyond the shadow of my true heart

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,500
Highest, highest, I'm the best

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:21,500
If you're going to ask me to go beyond the limit of my body, then come here

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,500
All of this, for now

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Until we reach the ideal

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,500
I'll reach out my hand

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,500
The choice that grows in front of me

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,500
The gears of good and evil are moving towards the end of one single thing

21
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Now, come on, cause I'm your choice

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
And I'm back to the end of life

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Until the limits of my body

24
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I'll look at the future

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Only one, I don't need anyone else

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
To be one, I just want to see it

27
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I'll keep my faith and determination in my heart

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Highest, highest, I'm the best

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I'll go beyond the shadow of my true heart

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Highest, highest, I'm the best

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:03:01,500
If you're going to ask me to go beyond the limit of my body, then come here
